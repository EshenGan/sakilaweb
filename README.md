# sakilaweb
Dynamic web developed by my friends and I as a group assignment in Year 2 back in May 2020

## LAMP stack
### L - Linux
### A - Apache
### M - MySQL
### P - PHP
HTML, CSS and JavaScript for frontend interactive and functional GUI
PHP for embedding all HTML scripts and for server-side scripting and rendering
all CSV data files are uploaded to [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and managed through [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/)
The website is hosted by [cPanel](https://cpanel.net/), a Linux-based control panel for web hosting which utilises [Apache HTTP servers](https://httpd.apache.org/).
